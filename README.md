# Duke_510_Project
Attendance Prediction of Duke Sporting Events

## Project Overview
Predictions for men's football and women's basketball home game attendance from 2016-2023.

## Code Overview
Code involved sourcing data from a weather API, as well as web scraping for sports dates and scores.

## Process
1) Sourced data from various websites using the following files
2) Merged data into one file
3) Initially cleaned the data
4) Performed EDA on data
5) Second cleaning of data before modeling
6) Modeling
7) Model evaluation

## Notebooks
Notebooks were used for exploration before solidifying code into .py scripts.

### attendance_fb.ipynb
Pulled football attendance data, and relevant game data from wikipedia using web scraping.

### attendance_wb.ipynb
Pulled women's basketball attendance data, and relevant game data from wikipedia using web scraping.

### calendar_dates.ipynb
TBD

### weather.ipynb
TBD

## Scripts
Scripts pull and manipulate data using functions. Some initial data updates were done external to scripts, since the data set was so small and manual updates took seconds to complete (vs extended time in code).

### attendance_fb.py
Pulled football attendance data, and relevant game data from wikipedia using web scraping.

### attendance_wb.py
Pulled women's basketball attendance data, and relevant game data from wikipedia using web scraping.

### Merging.py
TBD

### get_weather_data.py
